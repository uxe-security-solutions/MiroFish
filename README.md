## Overview

SoSim builds a high-fidelity synthetic society from source material you supply, runs
it forward, and reports what happened.

You give it seed material - a news package, a policy draft, an incident report, a
market brief, a novel - and a question in plain English. SoSim extracts the entities
and relationships into a temporal knowledge graph, generates a population of agents
with distinct personas, memories and behavioural rules, and then lets that population
interact on simulated Twitter and Reddit for as many rounds as you allow. Afterwards a
report agent interrogates the resulting graph and writes up the outcome, and you can
interview any individual agent about why it did what it did.

Everything runs on one machine. There is no hosted LLM, no hosted memory service, and
nothing leaves the box once setup has finished.

### Where it is useful

- **Macro** - a rehearsal lab for decision-makers. Test a policy, a disclosure or a
  crisis response against a population before it is real, at zero risk.
- **Micro** - a sandbox for exploring a scenario. Play out an alternative ending, a
  counterfactual, or a "what if we had said nothing".

## How a run works

1. **Graph building** - seed extraction, memory injection, GraphRAG construction.
2. **Environment setup** - entity and relationship extraction, persona generation,
   agent configuration.
3. **Simulation** - Twitter and Reddit run in parallel, the prediction question is
   parsed automatically, and the temporal graph is updated as the run proceeds.
4. **Report generation** - a report agent works the post-simulation graph with a
   toolset of searches, panoramas and agent interviews.
5. **Deep interaction** - chat with any agent in the simulated world, or with the
   report agent about its own report.

## Fully local deployment

The reference target is an **NVIDIA DGX Spark** (GB10, aarch64, 128GB unified memory),
but any Linux box with Docker and a working NVIDIA container runtime will do.

### Prerequisites

Docker with an NVIDIA container runtime, `sudo` for package installs, and ~120GB free
disk. The provisioning script installs everything else (uv, Node 22, build tools).

> Node 18 is **not** enough despite `package.json` saying so - the pinned Vite 7
> requires `^20.19 || >=22.12`, and `npm ci` only warns. The script installs Node 22.

### Running it

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:uxe-security-solutions/MiroFish.git
cd MiroFish
./scripts/provision_local.sh all
```

> The product is SoSim; the Git repository is still named `MiroFish`. That is
> deliberate - the repository is not being renamed, so every clone URL and remote
> path stays as it is.

If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, the script initialises the submodule
itself. `all` = `setup` then `start`:

```bash
./scripts/provision_local.sh setup    # packages, submodule, .env, images, models - NEEDS NETWORK
./scripts/provision_local.sh start    # bring the stack up - fully offline
./scripts/provision_local.sh status   # what is up, and where
./scripts/provision_local.sh logs llm # or: backend, zep-shim, frontend, embed, falkordb
./scripts/provision_local.sh doctor   # verify GPU arch, arm64 manifests, config sanity
./scripts/provision_local.sh test     # run both test suites (no GPU, no network)
./scripts/provision_local.sh stop
```

Add `-v` (or `VERBOSE=1`) to echo every external command as it runs.

`setup` is the only stage that touches the internet. After it completes the machine
can be disconnected: `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` and
`GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` are set in `.env.example`.

Review `.env` before the first `start` - it is created from `.env.example` and never
overwritten.

### Upgrading from a pre-rename checkout

The containers and the FalkorDB volume were renamed along with the product:
`mirofish-llm` / `mirofish-embed` / `mirofish-falkordb` are now `sosim-llm` /
`sosim-embed` / `sosim-falkordb`, and the volume `mirofish_falkordb` is now
`sosim_falkordb`.

**There is no data migration, and this is intentional.** FalkorDB comes up on a fresh
volume, so every graph built before the rename is gone. The old volume is left on disk
untouched rather than deleted behind your back; `start` names it and prints the command
to reclaim the space:

```bash
docker volume rm mirofish_falkordb
```

The old containers ran with `--restart unless-stopped`, so they come back after a
reboot and keep holding the GPU and ports 8000 / 8081 / 6379. `start` force-removes
them before it brings anything up, because the renamed containers cannot bind those
ports while they are alive.

### Wiping everything and starting again

Sometimes the right move is to throw away every graph, every simulation and every
uploaded document and reinstall. There is no single command for it, because the state
lives in four unrelated places: the shim's SQLite batch record, the FalkorDB volume,
the backend's upload tree, and `.env`.

> **Never delete `data/hf-cache/`.** It is bind-mounted into both vLLM containers with
> `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, so an empty cache does **not** quietly re-download the weights -
> the containers *fail to start*, and on a box that has since been disconnected you
> cannot get them back. This is the most destructive mistake available during a wipe,
> and `rm -rf data/` is how you make it. Delete the named files below, never the
> directory holding them.

```bash
cd /path/to/MiroFish
./scripts/provision_local.sh stop

# 1. The shim's SQLite state: which episodes of which build already committed.
#    BOTH paths, because which one is live depends on your .env vintage - the
#    ./data/zep_compat.sqlite3 this repo used to ship resolves against the shim's
#    own working directory, while an .env without the key lands in the repo's data/.
#    Normally you would compare them before touching either; here you are wiping.
rm -f data/zep_compat.sqlite3
rm -f third_party/graphiti/server/data/zep_compat.sqlite3

# 2. The graph database. `stop` only stops the container, and a volume cannot be
#    removed while any container still references it - even a stopped one.
#    "No such container" / "no such volume" here just means it was already gone.
docker rm -f sosim-falkordb mirofish-falkordb
docker volume rm sosim_falkordb
docker volume rm mirofish_falkordb   # the pre-rename orphan, if you still have it

# 3. Projects, simulations and reports - uploaded sources, agent state, output.
rm -rf backend/uploads/projects backend/uploads/simulations backend/uploads/reports

# 4. Take the current defaults. `setup` NEVER overwrites an existing .env, so without
#    this step the "fresh" install silently keeps every value you had tuned before.
#    data/ is gitignored, so the backup cannot be committed by accident.
mv .env data/env.pre-wipe.bak

./scripts/provision_local.sh setup   # recreates .env; weights and images are cached
./scripts/provision_local.sh start
```

`setup` is the right way back up, and it is quick after a wipe, because the weights are
still in `data/hf-cache/` and the images are still in Docker. Be precise about what it
does, though: it re-creates `.env` from `.env.example`, and then adds only the keys that
are *missing* from it — in practice just `ZEP_COMPAT_DB_PATH`, which a fresh copy does
not pin to an absolute path. It does **not**
re-derive the concurrency keys for this host's `MAX_NUM_SEQS`. `ensure_env_key` only
writes a key that is *absent*, and the fresh copy already carries `SIM_LLM_SEMAPHORE`,
`ZEP_COMPAT_BATCH_CONCURRENCY` and `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` at the values derived for the
default `MAX_NUM_SEQS=16`, so none of them fires (the script's own comment says so).

**If you run a non-default `MAX_NUM_SEQS`, edit those three keys by hand** in the new
`.env` — `SIM_LLM_SEMAPHORE` is half of it, and
`ZEP_COMPAT_BATCH_CONCURRENCY × SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` must stay at or under
`MAX_NUM_SEQS / 2` — then check the result with the same value in the environment:

```bash
MAX_NUM_SEQS=32 ./scripts/provision_local.sh doctor
```

Both `setup` and `doctor` re-check that product against the current `MAX_NUM_SEQS` and
report it as a failure when it no longer fits. Neither of them rewrites it for you.

**On an air-gapped box, `setup` will report a failed download for each model** - its
`fetch_models` stage forces `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=0` deliberately, so it always tries the
network. Everything else has already been done by the time it gets there, so the run is
still useful. If you would rather not see the failures, replace step 4 and `setup` with:

```bash
mv .env data/env.pre-wipe.bak && cp .env.example .env
./scripts/provision_local.sh start
```

Then put back anything you had deliberately tuned, and re-check the result:

```bash
diff data/env.pre-wipe.bak .env
./scripts/provision_local.sh doctor
```

Also *not* part of the wipe: `data/logs/` (append-only, and it holds the evidence for
whatever made you wipe) and `data/run/` (pidfiles, already cleared by `stop`).

### Reading the output when something breaks

Failures are designed to be impossible to miss from the console alone:

- Each one prints `✗ FAILED: <what>` the moment it happens.
- **The relevant log tail is dumped inline** - a service that dies on startup shows
  you *why* (`sh: vite: command not found`, a vLLM flag rejection, an OOM) rather than
  only surfacing as a health-check timeout minutes later.
- Every container is checked for liveness a few seconds after launch, and every
  background process is checked 2s after launch, so an instant exit is caught at the
  point it happens.
- `start` deliberately **continues past a failure** so you get the whole picture in one
  run instead of stopping at the first problem.
- All failures are listed again at exit, and the script **exits non-zero** - so it
  composes with CI or `&&`.

Health-gate patience is tunable, which matters on slower storage (a first model load
reads tens of GB) and for failing fast while testing: `EMBED_WAIT_TRIES`,
`LLM_WAIT_TRIES`, `SHIM_WAIT_TRIES`, `BACKEND_WAIT_TRIES`, `FRONTEND_WAIT_TRIES` - each
counts 2-second polls.

### When a simulation runs but records no actions

A run that reports rounds against an empty action log is not a simulation of a quiet
crowd - it is a model backend that answered none of the agents. The round loop absorbs
per-agent failures on purpose, so nothing in the round count distinguishes the two.

Ask the endpoint directly. This sends **one agent-shaped request** - an agent-sized
prompt, the same tool schemas, the same timeout and output cap the agents get - and
says which limit it hits:

```bash
backend/.venv/bin/python backend/scripts/run_parallel_simulation.py --preflight-only
```

`./scripts/provision_local.sh doctor` runs the same check. The three answers that
matter, and what each one means:

| What it reports | What is wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `APITimeoutError ... did not finish an agent-sized one within Ns` | The endpoint is up but cannot finish a real request in time - it is overloaded, still loading a model, or wedged | Check `docker logs sosim-llm`; lower `SIM_LLM_SEMAPHORE`, or raise `SIM_MODEL_TIMEOUT` |
| `finish_reason=length ... spent the cap on a reasoning block` | A hybrid model is in reasoning mode, so it never reaches the tool call | Set `SIM_MODEL_EXTRA_BODY={"chat_template_kwargs":{"enable_thinking":false}}`, or serve vLLM with a matching `--reasoning-parser` |
| `answered in prose but called no tool` | Tool calling is off or the parser does not match what this model emits | Check `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and `--tool-call-parser` (`hermes` vs `qwen3_xml` for Qwen3 builds) |

The knob behind the second row is the one worth knowing about in advance.
**camel-ai sends no `max_tokens` of its own**, and vLLM then lets a generation run to
`--max-model-len` minus the prompt - around 30k tokens on the shipped settings. A model
that opens with a `<think>` block will spend that budget, and at the per-stream decode
rate of a fully batched local server it cannot finish inside any sane timeout: every
agent request times out and the run records nothing. `SIM_MODEL_MAX_TOKENS` (default
1024) bounds it, which turns that silent multi-hour timeout into an immediate
`finish_reason="length"` the preflight can explain.

A run that gets past the preflight and still stalls aborts itself: one round that
activates agents, records nothing, and takes longer than `SIM_MODEL_TIMEOUT` is enough
to stop, because agents that choose to do nothing answer quickly.

### Ports to open on the network

**Expose exactly one port.**

| Port | Service | Expose? |
|---|---|---|
| **3000** | Frontend (Vite) | **Yes** - this is the whole application. It proxies `/api` to the backend. |
| 5001 | Backend API (Flask) | No - reached through the frontend proxy |
| 8088 | Zep-compatible shim | No |
| 8000 | vLLM (OpenAI-compatible) | No |
| 8081 | Embeddings (vLLM, pooling mode) | No |
| 6379 | FalkorDB | No |
| 3001 | FalkorDB browser UI | No - handy over an SSH tunnel |

Everything except 3000 binds to `127.0.0.1`, so a host firewall is a backstop, not the
primary control. For example:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp
```

Then open `http://<host-ip>:3000`. To reach it by hostname instead of IP, set
`VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `.env` - Vite rejects unknown `Host` headers (bare IPs always
work).

For anything beyond a trusted LAN, put a reverse proxy with TLS in front of 3000 rather
than exposing Vite's dev server directly. Note the backend has no auth of its own:
whoever reaches the UI can drive simulations.

### What runs where

```
browser ──▶ :3000 Vite ──/api──▶ :5001 backend ──▶ :8088 Zep shim ──▶ :6379 FalkorDB
                                      │                   │
                                      └───────────────────┴──▶ :8000 vLLM  (agents + extraction)
                                                          └──▶ :8081 vLLM  (embeddings, pooling)
```

The shim needs an embeddings endpoint because Zep Cloud did embedding server-side and
Graphiti does not. `EMBEDDING_DIM` is **a one-way door**: the vector index dimension is
fixed at creation, so changing embedders later means re-embedding every graph. The
default (bge-m3, 1024) matches Graphiti's default exactly.

### Model choices

Defaults are set in `scripts/provision_local.sh` and overridable by environment:

- **LLM** - `RedHatAI/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4`. A Mixture-of-Experts model is the right
  shape here: GB10 has ~273 GB/s of bandwidth, decode is bandwidth-bound, and MoE reads
  far fewer weights per token.
- **Embeddings** - `BAAI/bge-m3` on a second vLLM container in pooling mode.
  HuggingFace TEI would have been the obvious choice but publishes **no arm64 image at
  all** - every `cpu-*` tag is amd64-only. Reusing the vLLM image means one fewer
  dependency and a guaranteed arm64 build. It takes a small slice of GPU memory
  (`EMBED_GPU_MEM_UTIL`, default `0.08`); `GPU_MEM_UTIL` for the main LLM is
  correspondingly `0.70`, and the two must sum well under 1.0 because each is a
  fraction of *total* memory.
- **Graph DB** - FalkorDB (Redis-based, no JVM). Neo4j works too:
  `GRAPHITI_DB_BACKEND=neo4j`.

Two different requirements land on that one LLM endpoint, and both matter:

- OASIS agents use **native OpenAI tool calling**. Without
  `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser`, every agent silently does nothing.
- Graphiti uses **`response_format: json_schema`**, not tool calling. Its lever is
  vLLM's structured-output backend. Tuning tool-call flags does nothing for extraction
  quality.

### Sizing and expectations, honestly

- `GPU_MEM_UTIL` defaults to a conservative `0.70`. It is a fraction of *total* device
  memory, and on unified memory that competes with the OS, the container runtime and
  the page cache. `0.90` has been reported getting the engine SIGTERM'd by `earlyoom`,
  which does **not** look like an OOM in the logs.
- `MAX_NUM_SEQS` defaults to 16, and SoSim's own OASIS concurrency is 30. Independent
  reports put practical GB10 concurrency at 5-10 before latency degrades badly, and
  NVIDIA's own vLLM playbook uses `--max-num-seqs 4`. Sweep 1/4/8/16/32 and measure p95
  latency before trusting a number.
- Start with **few agents and few rounds**. Every round is many LLM calls per agent;
  even a paid API gets expensive past 40 rounds.
- A **Twitter** simulation loads `Twitter/twhin-bert-base` (~1GB) for its recommender;
  `setup` pre-caches it. **Reddit** needs no model at all, so Reddit-only runs are the
  lighter path.
- SoSim's own Python process gets **CPU-only torch** on aarch64 (no CUDA wheels there).
  That is fine - it only uses torch for the small recommender model. The GPU is for the
  vLLM server.

### Testing without a GPU

Both suites run on a laptop, no GPU, no network, no LLM:

```bash
./scripts/provision_local.sh test
```

The shim's tests are worth knowing about, because they are what makes the drop-in claim
checkable:

- `test_zep_compat_contract.py` - serialises every response model and parses it with
  **zep-cloud's own** `parse_obj_as`, the exact code SoSim runs.
- `test_zep_compat_e2e.py` - drives the shim with a **real `AsyncZep` client** over an
  ASGI transport: real paths, bodies, error mapping, and the header-based pagination
  cursor.
- `test_zep_compat_store.py` - the batch invariants SoSim's reconciliation depends on
  (global `sequence_index`, cursors that must advance, restart durability).
- `test_zep_compat_integration.py` - opt-in, against a real FalkorDB:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name falkordb-it -p 6399:6379 falkordb/falkordb:latest
  cd third_party/graphiti/server
  ZEP_COMPAT_IT=1 FALKORDB_IT_PORT=6399 uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_zep_compat_integration.py -v
  ```

## Running from source, without the provisioning script

Useful on a developer machine where the model servers already exist somewhere else.
Point `LLM_BASE_URL` and `ZEP_BASE_URL` in `.env` at whatever is serving them.

| Tool | Version | Check |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | >=20.19 or >=22.12 | `node -v` |
| Python | >=3.11, <3.13 | `python --version` |
| uv | latest | `uv --version` |

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # then edit it
npm run setup:all          # root + frontend + backend dependencies
npm run dev                # frontend on :3000, backend on :5001
```

`npm run backend` and `npm run frontend` start the halves individually.

## Known limitations

- **Not every Zep endpoint is implemented** - only the 17 SoSim actually calls.
  `third_party/graphiti/server/graph_service/zep_compat/WIRE_SPEC.md` lists the
  contract and how it was derived. Users, threads and fact-triples are not covered.
- **`graph_id` becomes a database name.** Graphiti 0.29.3 maps `group_id` onto the
  graph database name, so each SoSim graph is a separate FalkorDB database and the shim
  keeps one Graphiti instance per graph. Node and episode UUIDs are only resolvable
  inside their own graph, so the shim keeps a UUID-to-graph index for the two Zep routes
  that look up a UUID with no `graph_id`.
- **`uuid_cursor` paging is broken on FalkorDB** in graphiti-core 0.29.3: the
  `WHERE n.uuid < $uuid` clause is silently not applied, so every page comes back
  identical. The shim pages with `SKIP`/`LIMIT` instead (`zep_compat/paging.py`). That
  is stable as long as the graph is not written during a drain, which holds because
  SoSim reads only after a batch reaches a terminal status.
- **Extraction quality depends on the local model** honouring `json_schema`. If entity
  extraction comes back thin, that is the thing to tune first - try a larger model
  before blaming the pipeline.
- The report agent uses text `<tool_call>` tags rather than the tool-calling API, so it
  is the most model-agnostic part of the system.

## What this fork changed

SoSim is a fork of [MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish). Upstream depends on
two hosted services. The LLM was a config change; Zep was not.

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| **Added `third_party/graphiti`** submodule ([our fork](https://github.com/uxe-security-solutions/graphiti)) | Contains `server/graph_service/zep_compat/`, a Zep Cloud v2 API implementation backed by Graphiti - the same open-source temporal knowledge graph engine Zep Cloud is built on. Zep Community Edition is discontinued and no self-hostable Zep server exists, so this had to be written. |
| **`ZEP_BASE_URL`** in [`backend/app/utils/zep.py`](backend/app/utils/zep.py) | Upstream hard-coded `https://api.getzep.com/api/v2` and rejected any override. Unset, behaviour is unchanged; set, the SDK talks to the local shim. `ZEP_API_URL` stays rejected - the SDK honours it over an explicit `base_url`, so allowing both would make the effective endpoint ambiguous. |
| **`ZEP_INGESTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`** now configurable | Was a hard-coded 600s. Cloud ingests well inside that; a local LLM extracting entities from a few hundred chunks does not, and overrunning raises `TimeoutError` while ingestion is still healthy. |
| **Frontend uses same-origin URLs** ([`frontend/src/api/index.js`](frontend/src/api/index.js)) | The default `http://localhost:5001` was resolved by the *browser*, so opening the UI from any other machine hit that machine's own port 5001 and failed. Every request path already starts with `/api`, which Vite proxies. **This is why only one port needs exposing.** |
| **Vite config hardened** ([`frontend/vite.config.js`](frontend/vite.config.js)) | `open: false` (headless boxes have no `xdg-open`), `strictPort: true` (it silently slid to 3001, leaving firewall rules pointing at nothing), `host: true`, and `allowedHosts` via env. |
| **Google Fonts removed** ([`frontend/index.html`](frontend/index.html)) | The only external request the frontend made; on an air-gapped box it stalls first paint until it times out. The font stack now falls back to whatever is installed, and `setup` installs `fonts-inter` and `fonts-jetbrains-mono` to match the design tokens. |
| **English-only** | The Chinese locale, the runtime language switcher and the backend locale layer are gone; the UI and every LLM instruction are compiled-in English. |
| **Added [`backend/conftest.py`](backend/conftest.py)** | `pytest` worked only via `python -m pytest`; now either form does. |
| **Added [`scripts/provision_local.sh`](scripts/provision_local.sh)** | One script for the whole stack. |
