    Prepare a simulation environment as a background task, with the LLM generating every parameter.
    
    Preparation takes minutes, so this returns a task_id immediately.
    Poll GET /api/simulation/prepare/status for progress.
    
    Behaviour:
    - Detects work that is already prepared and does not regenerate it
    - Returns the existing result when the simulation is already prepared
    - Regenerates everything when force_regenerate=true
    - Answers HTTP 409 with coalesced=true, pending=true and the task_id of
      the preparation already running in this process, force_regenerate
      included. Two preparation threads interleave their writes to the same
      profile and config files and the loser silently overwrites the winner,
      so the second caller follows the first task rather than starting one.
      coalesced marks this as benign: nothing failed, and the run the caller
      asked for is under way.

    Steps:
    1. Check for preparation that already finished
    2. Read and filter the entities out of the Zep graph
    3. Generate an OASIS agent profile per entity, with retries
    4. Ask the LLM for the simulation configuration, with retries
    5. Write the configuration file and the preset scripts

    About force:
        - When set, a running or completed simulation is stopped and its logs cleared first
        - The cleanup runs for every status, READY included, not only for a
          simulation caught mid-run: force_restarted=true in the response means
          the logs really were cleared
        - Cleared: run_state.json, actions.jsonl, simulation.log and the like
        - Kept: simulation_config.json and the profile files
        - Use it whenever a simulation has to run again from the start

    About enable_graph_memory_update:
        - When set, every agent action - posts, comments, likes - is written into the Zep graph as it happens
        - This lets the graph "remember" the run, for later analysis or chat
        - The simulation's project must have a valid graph_id
        - Writes are batched, to keep the API call count down

@simulation_bp.route('/restart', methods=['POST'])
def restart_simulation():
    """
    Restart a simulation from a clean slate.

    This is what the Simulations menu's Restart calls. It always quiesces the
    previous run and clears its output before relaunching: the child appends to
    twitter/actions.jsonl and reddit/actions.jsonl while a new monitor reads
    them from byte 0, so a restart that skips the cleanup replays the whole
    previous run - it re-counts every action, trips the completion flags off
    the old simulation_end events, and pushes every old action to Zep a second
    time. A completed simulation restarted through POST /start without
    force=true does exactly that, which is why Restart is its own route.

    It also rescues a simulation stranded in 'preparing'. Preparation runs in a
    daemon thread, so a backend restart kills it without raising and no failure
    handler runs; the row then sits in 'preparing' forever and every start is
    refused with "Simulation not ready". Restart rests such a simulation at
    ready when its files are complete, and at failed otherwise.

    Re-entry: restart does NOT supersede a preparation that is genuinely in
    flight in this process. It refuses with HTTP 409, pending=true and
    preparation_live=true, naming the task to follow. There is no cancellation
    point in the preparation thread, so superseding it would leave two writers
    racing over the same profile and config files. The same guard is on POST
    /prepare. A claim whose thread has died is NOT in flight: it is dropped,
    the restart proceeds into the rescue above, and the reply says so with
    cleared_dead_preparation=true. Refusing on a dead claim used to leave the
    simulation with no way out of 'preparing' short of a backend restart.

    A LIVE run is refused with HTTP 409 unless force=true, exactly as POST
    /start refuses one. The restart is destructive - it reaps the child and
    deletes run_state.json, simulation.log, both actions.jsonl files and both
    platform databases - so it cannot be left to the frontend's disabled menu
    item: a curl, a template regression or any other programmatic caller
    reaches this route directly.
